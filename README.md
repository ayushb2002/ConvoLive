This project is based on idea of real time communication. Therefore, I present to you a very simple website called "ConvoLive". User visiting the website for the first time will be prompted to enter his/her name. Remember that the name cannot be set as 'Admin'. Next, the user will be asked to either create their own new room or join any other room which should be currently available. User then will be directed to chat area, where the real time communication takes place. People can communicate with each other and can delete their message if they require to. Finally, the user can delete the self created room by using the room name and password. User may or may not logout as the website remembers the user information and when user comes back, website redirects to the last page where user has left from. 

This project uses Flask, SocketIO, Javascript, Jinja, HTML and CSS. The required packages are included in requirements.txt.
